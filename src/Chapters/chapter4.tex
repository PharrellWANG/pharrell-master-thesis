%Welcome to this \LaTeX{} Thesis Template, a beautiful and easy to use template for writing a thesis using the \LaTeX{} typesetting system.
%
%If you are writing a thesis (or will be in the future) and its subject is technical or mathematical (though it doesn't have to be), then creating it in \LaTeX{} is highly recommended as a way to make sure you can just get down to the essential writing without having to worry over formatting or wasting time arguing with your word processor.
%
%\LaTeX{} is easily able to~\parencite{RN93} professionally typeset documents that run to hundreds or thousands of pages long. With simple mark-up commands, it automatically sets out the table of contents, margins, page headers and footers and keeps the formatting consistent and beautiful. One of its main strengths is the way it can easily typeset mathematics, even \emph{heavy} mathematics. Even if those equations are the most horribly twisted and most difficult mathematical problems that can only be solved on a super-computer, you can at least count on \LaTeX{} to make them look stunning.
