In this dissertation we have presented a fast
intra mode decision algorithm to
address the time cost issue of depth map coding
in 3D-HEVC, leveraging 
the learned models, which are constructed from deep
convolutional neural networks, to predict the wedgelet angles
for the CUs in the depth maps.
The predictions from the learned models are capable of
reducing the number of DMM1 wedgelet candidates by half.
The size of the neural network has been carefully designed to balance
the trade-off between complexity and accuracy of model prediction.
Validation precision and confusion matrix are 
at the core of the stopping criteria.
Top-k metric is adopted to make use of the predictions
from the learned models.
The learned models are integrated into the reference software of
3D-HEVC for the simulations.
The compiled executable binaries are able to harness
the power of simultaneous computation of CPU, as well as
parallel computation of GPU to accelerate the 
predictions.
The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm
provides 64.6\% time reduction in average 
for DMM1 wedgelet searching
in depth maps while the
BD performance has a trivial decrease comparing 
with the most recent implementation of 3D-HEVC
standard.
