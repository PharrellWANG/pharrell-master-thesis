    \prefacesection{Abstract}
    With the rising popularity of the high definition videos, the new standard
    termed High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) for compressing videos in a more
    efficient way comparing with previous standards, such as H.264/AVC, has
    emerged under the efforts from the Joint Collaborative Team on Video
    Coding (JCT-VC).
    In the meanwhile, five extensions of the HEVC standard, comprising
    Format Range Extension (RExt), Scalability Extension (SHVC),
    Multi-view Extension (MV-HEVC), 3D Extension (3D-HEVC),
    Screen Content Coding Extension (SCC),  have been finalized
    from 2014 to 2016 to support fulfill extra requirements in various
    scenarios.
    3D Video applications are attracting more interests
